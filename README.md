# minecraft_clone
My own implementation of Mojang's "Minecraft". Inspired by Hopson97 and his video on YouTube, built entirely from scratch.

Dependencies:
- glad (OpenGL 4.6 loader)
- GLFW 3.3
- glm
- stb_image (stb_image.h)
- FastNoiseLite (noise.h)

Note: All release binaries are compiled with MSVC in Visual Studio 2022 for 64 bit Windows. Good luck building it on any other platforms.
